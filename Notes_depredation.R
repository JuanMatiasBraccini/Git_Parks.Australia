Indices used to quantify depredation and bycatch levels
We used the NOP dataset to quantify depredation based on three of the indices defined by
Rabearisoa et al. (2018): the interaction rate (IR), the gross depredation rate (GDR) and the depredation per unit effort (DPUE). 
The IR was used to assess how often depredation occurred. It was calculated as the proportion (%) of
sets on which catches were depredated (at least one depredated fish) out of all sets: 
  IR =100* nb of depredated sets /total nb of sets (where nb is number)
The GDR was used to assess the amplitude of fish damaged by depredation. It was calculated as the
proportion (%) of fish depredated out of the total number of fishes caught (whether depredated or not): 
  GDR =100* nb of depredated catch/ total nb of catch

When depredation occurred on a given set, the DPUE indicated the amount of fish depredated as a
function of the fishing effort expressed as the number of hooks deployed. For each depredated set i, it
was calculated as the number of fishes depredated for every 1,000 hooks deployed:
  DPUEi =1000 * depredated catchi / hooksi
