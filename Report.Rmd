# Executive summary

# Introduction
The Temperate Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Managed Fisheries (TDGDLF) comprise of the West Coast Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline (Interim) Managed Fishery (WCDGDLF), which operates between 26° and 33° S, and the Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Managed Fishery (SDGDLF), which operates from 33° S to the WA/SA border. Fishers in the TDGDLF employ mostly demersal gillnets to target mainly sharks with scalefish being a byproduct. Demersal longline is also permitted but is not widely used. 
Whilst gillnets are used worldwide to catch a range of species and are considered size selective, they do not necessarily discriminate among species, catching target and non-target species and as such have been labelled indiscriminate ‘walls of death’ (e.g. The West Australian, 26 September 2012). Additionally, sectors of the public and many environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGO) consider the incidental catch of charismatic species (e.g. marine birds, mammals and turtles) unacceptable, even when the sustanability risks imposed to those populations may be negligible. A recent example of this was the support gained by the eNGO sector to implement gillnet exclusion zones around Australian sea lion colonies (ASL Zones) in the TDGDLF.
The introduction of ASL Zones and Commonwealth Marine Park closures in mid-2018 has excluded areas to demersal gillnets, consequently significantly reducing the area traditionally fished by operators in the TDGDLF. This is especially evident in zone 2 of the SDGDLF and the WCDGDLF. In response to this, a working group consisting of the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (WAFIC) and the Southern Seafood Producers Association (SSPA) received funding from Parks Australia as part of the Commonwealth Marine Parks Grants Assistance Program. The objective of the current project is to address key issues and questions relating to the use of gillnet and longlines by TDGDLF fishers. Specifically, a better understanding is required on changes in fishing efficiency (required for allowing unbiased stock assessments), catch composition (sharks and scalefish), and impacts on habitat and Endangered Threatened and Protected (ETPs) species from the use of gillnets or longlines. Also, social and economic considerations must be understood. This will be achieved collectively via two Phases to the Project: 1) Phase one involved a desktop study for reviewing what is currently known about the fishing methods used in the TDGDLF; 2) Phase two involved data collection through a fishing survey to compare the catch composition, catch rates, and habitat impacts of demersal gillnets and longlines using both onboard observer (OM) and electronic (EM) monitoring using a range of different camera systems.


# Methods

## Phase one - Review of available commercial catch and effort data

### Data collection
A desktop study was done to review available information on the gear used in the TDGDLF with a focus on the catch composition of demersal gillnet and demersal longline, the selectivity of demersal gillnet and demersal longline, interactions between demersal gillnet and demersal longline and ETP species, habitat or broader ecosystem impacts with demersal gillnet and demersal longline, and historical change or evolution in use of demersal gillnet and demersal longlines. Data were obtained from the literature and DPIRD's catch and effort systems. Only daily logbooks (catch and effort records reported since 2006-07) were considered given the higher spatial and species reporting resolution compared to the period 1975-76 to 2005-06 when catch and effort records were aggregated at a coarser level. 

### Data analyses
Data manipulation and analysis was done using the statistical package R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2014]. Differences in catch composition between demersal gillnets and longlines were tested with multivariate statistics using the package *vegan*. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) on proportional data and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities was used to collapse the multivariate species composition into two dimensions. Adonis was used to test for significant differences between fishing method and zone, fitted as a combined term method-zone. Similarity Percentage (SIMPER) Analysis was used to determine the contribution of each species to the dissimilarity between fishing zones and gears. For the multivariate analysis, Zone 1 was excluded due to the very low number of longline records.
For the main commercial shark and scalefish species, catch rates were standardized using generalized linear models (GLMs). The models had catch rate as response variable (kg per 1000 m hour or 1000 hook hours for gillnets and longlines, respectively) and fishing zone and vessel as terms for the gillnet model, and fishing zone, vessel, hook type and hook size as terms for the longline model. A Tweedie distribution with a log link was used considering the relatively high proportion of records with zero catch.

## Phase two - Fishing survey
### Commercial fishing vessel chartering and onboard observer program
Three TDGDLF gillnet fishing vessels were chartered to simultaneously fish with demersal gillnets and demersal longlines. Vessels were selected based **on a tender process XXX (Maddie/Clint to specify vessel selection and SLA)**. **Here describe how longline was set and hauled using the net winch or dedicated winch in case of Anthony (Jack to do)**
Sampling follow standard commercial fishing operations with skippers allowed to determine when and where to set the gear. The gillnet was supplied by each fisher and consisted of the same gear configuration used in TDGDLF standard commercial operations (i.e. monofilament webbing with a mesh size of 6.5 inches) as per described in [@McAuley2003a] and [@McAuley2007a], but with a length of up to 3000 m. The longline was ~1,500 m long and comprised of ~240 hooks of different size (10/0, 12/0 and 14/0) and shape (tuna circle hooks and Ezi-baiter) attached to the main line (**X** cm diameter) via ~60 cm metal (**X** cm diameter) or monofilament (**X** cm diameter) snoods. Approximately 20 of each snood type—hook type—hook size combinations were deployed in each gear deployment. Each hook was manually baited with squid, octopus, mullet, whiting, herring or pilchards. Approximately 10 snoods were clipped to the main line between each weight and pressure float which allowed sampling close to the bottom and into the water column (Figure 1). Gillnets were deployed for between 0.7 and 23.4 hours (mean = 12.2 hours) and longlines were deployed for 0.8 and 20.8 hours (mean = 10.9 hours).
A tori line was used to minimize the seabird interactions during longline deployments.

Two to three scientific observers were onboard each vessel and collected data on GPS location, depth, date, time and catch composition for each observed shot, which were conducted in the West and South Coasts (Figure 2) between July 2020 and August 2021 in depths of **X-Y** m. Each individual caught was identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible, measured (fork length for sharks, disc width for southern eagle rays and total length for scalefish) and recorded as retained or discarded by the fisher. Sharks and rays were also sexed and, for the main commercial shark species, vertebrae were collected from the anterior part of the trunk for future ageing analyses and construction of catch age compositions. Discarded individuals were assigned a release condition classed as 0 (dead), 1 (individual swam off strongly and did not remain at the surface), 2 (individual swam off moderately strongly and typically swam at the surface for a period), or 3 (individual swam off in poor condition or did not appear to swim) [@MatiasBraccini2019].

#### Data analyses
A similar approach to Phase 1 analyses was used to test the effects of fishing gear and zone in the catch composition. 
For the most commonly-caught species, the size distributions obtained from gillnet and longline sampling were compared using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov D test and by estimating the area overlap of the kernel densities using the package *overlapping*. In addition, a GLM model was constructed with size as response variable and fishing zone and gear as model terms. A normal distribution was assumed. For longline-caught fish, a model was also constructed to test the effect of hook size, hook type and snood type on mean size. A GLM with a binomial distribution was used to test for differences between gillnets and longlines in the probability of retaining an individual. 
To measure the congruence between EM and OM, the catch composition (number of individuals per species) reported by onboard observers was compared to that obtained from the analysis of video footage collected by deck camera 1 (see below). Following [@Emery2019], a GLM was constructed where the response variable was the count of individuals from EM and predictors were the count of individuals from OM and fishing gear. The OM coefficient and the intercept are expected to follow a 1:1 relationship (slope of 1 and intercept of 0).  Differences in reporting by individual species were determined by calculating the percentage difference between OM and EM. This was calculated as the difference between the number of individuals of a given species reported by EM and by OM divided by the number of individuals of that species with the greatest number.
Hook size selectivity for circular and Ezi-Baiter hooks was estimated from longline-caught fish using the SELECT (share each length’s catch total) method developed by [@Millar1997] available through the package *gillnetfunctions*. The SELECT method considers normal, gamma or lognormal distributions so the ‘best curve’ was determined based on the deviance explained. Only species with at least 30 size observations per hook size were considered for this analysis.    


### Image collection
#### Underwater cameras
Mono gillnet, longline underwater video (GLUVs) were developed for this unique study. The GLUVs comprised one Sony FRD-x3000 action camera, mounted in an underwater housing. These housings were attached to an aluminium bracket with shark clips. This allowed the camera housing to be attached to the gillnet and longline mainline (Figure 3). The GLUVs were made neutrally buoyant so they did not compromise the way the fishing gear would normally sit in the water column. 10 GLUVs  were attached to the gillnets with a 45°angle to observe down the gillnet. Eight GLUVs were attached to the longline; these cameras were positioned to observe straight along the longline so they were not angled. Each camera was attached to the fishing gear as it was deployed and recorded for the whole deployment period, mostly ranging between 4-6 hours for longlines and 6-8 for gillnets. Cameras were randomly positioned but were separated by at least 50m. GLUVs were only deployed during the day.

```

#### Deck cameras
Two Sony FRD-x3000 action cameras were mounted in two different locations around the deck of the fishing vessels (Figure 4). Deck camera 1 was positioned above the wheelhouse pointing towards the deck where fish were measured and processed. This camera allowed the identification of all fish that were caught and brought onboard the fishing vessels. This camera allowed the comparison of what was recorded by the onboard observers and the video footage recorded by the camera and later analyzed in the lab. This camera also allowed quantifying the amount of habitat caught in the fishing gear and brought onto fishing vessels as a relative measure of habitat impact by longlines and gillnets. 
Deck camera 2 was positioned above the retrieval roller of the vessel. This camera allowed recording the number of individuals that dropped out of the fishing gear during retrieval and if a crew member was able to recover the drop outs with a gaff before being lost. This camera also quantifying the position of longline-caught fish relative to a weight (i.e. caught closer to the sea floor) or pressure float (i.e. caught higher in the water column) as a way of inferring the relative position of that caught fish in the water column.

### Image analyses
#### Underwater cameras
All video footage was downloaded onto external hard drives and analysed back in the lab using the software ‘EventMeasure (Stereo)’ [@Seager2014]. Video images from the GLUVs were reviewed for both the maximum number of individuals of each species observed (MaxN) and for the type of interactions between fish and the two fishing gears. Al observed individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level. To avoid repeatedly counting individual fish that continuously re-entered the cameras fields of view, the maximum number of individuals of the same species that appeared in the one frame at the same time (MaxN) was used as a measure of relative abundance. MaxN allows for a conservative estimate of relative abundance. One limitation of video analysis with GLUVs was that occasionally it was not possible to identify species due to impaired visibility due to lighting or depth or a restricted field of view of the cameras. If individual species could not be determined, species were grouped to Genus or Family level.
Interactions with fishing gear were quantified as per described in Table 1 and recorded in Event Measure. Example reference videos were made in order to standardise classification of the interaction types (Figure 6). Finally, if a fish interacted by being caught on the fishing gear, the observer would time how long it was caught in the gear. This will allow us to understand the escape ration of animals that get caught by the fishing gear and their survival rates. If the fish is caught and landed then the time is still taken on how long it is in the net, to allow us to disentangle the effective soak times of the different fishing gear.

Information on benthic habitat structure and composition was collected using the Transect Measure software. As each camera stayed stationary, only one image per camera needed to be analysed. To determine benthic cover a virtual quadrat was placed over the seafloor that was visible in the image. Individually defining the quadrant this way allowed for the quadrats to be adaptive as every camera could have a different view and some should only be able to see a relatively small section of benthic habitat if it was tangled in the fishing gear during deployment. Within each quadrat 20 random points were overlayed over the benthic cover. Each point was categorised using the CATAMI guide [@Althaus2013]. Benthic cover was first classified into the following broad categories (**LIST OF WHAT THEY WERE ...MISSING, Jack to do**). These where then further broken down into finer categories based on their morphological form (**LIST OF THEM...MISSING, Jack to do**), health (**LIST THEM...MISSING, Jack to do**) and condition (**list them...MISSING, Jack to do**) (Table 2).

Table 2. Benthic cover classification based on morphology, health and condition (**MISSING, Jack to do**)


#### Deck cameras
Deck camera footage was analysed in Event Measure and according to camera position. For deck camera 1, all individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level. Fish were identified once they were positioned on the measuring table to better compare the catch composition recorded by onboard observed with those recorded by the video observer. Video observers also noted the condition of each individual brought on board, whether it was alive or dead, retained or released and for gillnets, whether it was gilled (i.e. the net mesh had caught the fish around the gills) or bagged (i.e. the fish had become tangled in the net). To quantify relative habitat damage by gillnets the percentage of the net that had habitat caught in it. The fishing gear was watched as it passed from the retrieval roller to the net roller and this distance was calculated for each vessel. **THIS NEEDS BETTER EXPLAINATION (Jack to do)**. Habitat was classified into several categories: Reef Structure, Sponge and Coral, which were quantified into percentage cover. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and *Ecklonia radiata* were also quantified, however due to current, and swell, seagrass and macro algae could be caught in the nets while suspended in the water column. As the aim was to determine damage small amounts of algae and seagrasses were ignored as it was unknown if their presence was actually damage. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and *Ecklonia radiata* were quantified in 5% intervals starting from 10% and coverages less than 10%.
For deck camera 2, individuals were also identified to the lowest taxonomic level. When the longline was retrieved, the position of fish caught in relation to the closest pressure float or weight was recorded to calculate the relative position of the caught-fish in the water column. Fish caught more than 3 hooks from a pressure float or weight (Figure 1) were not recorded. Finally, if a fish dropped out of a gillnet or longline was also recorded, as well as if the fish was recovered by a crew member with a gaff immediately after dropping out.

#### Subsurface camera
For the subsurface camera individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and dropouts were recorded to determine the amount of individuals lost before the fishing gear was brought onto the boat. If the captured individuals dropped out of the gear its retrieval by the crew was noted, as well as the individual’s condition (to determine the survival rate of captured fish on the fishing gear (dead, i.e. the individual swam off or alive, i.e. the individual sank). 

#### Data analyses
The multivariate statistics described in Phase were applied to compare the interactions type derived from underwater cameras by taxonomic group (sharks, rays, scalefish, invertebrates). For the most commonly-caught species, a GLM with a binomial distribution was used to test for differences between gillnets and longlines in the probability of dropout and of capture near a weight or pressure float (longline-caught fish only).

### Satellite tagging
Port Jackson sharks, *Heterodontus portusjacksoni*, are by far the most-commonly discarded elasmobranch in the TDGDLF [@McAuley2003a]. This species is very robust and has very low at-deck post-capture mortality when caught in demersal gillnets [@Braccini2012]. Indirect methods suggest a very high delayed post-release survival (PRS). However, these findings have not been validated through direct method suchs tagging. Hence, to provide a quantitative validation of the survival of Port Jackson sharks upon release from demersal gillnets, 6 randomly chosen individuals caught in demersal gillnets were fitted with survivorship pop-up archival transmitting (sPAT) tags (Model MK10, Wildlife Computers Inc., Figure 7) tethered to a nylon intramuscular anchor inserted at the base of the dorsal fin. The tags are designed to record depth, temperature and light information, which was archived at 24-hour intervals for the entire deployment period, and ten-minute intervals for the last five days of deployment.

```
![Figure 7. Deployment of sPAT tags on Port Jackson sharks.](`r path`){width=800px}

The tags were programmed to detached and transmit data to the ARGOS satellite system after a 30 day deployment. Initially, the default settings were maintained (i.e. activate once the individual swam below 10 meters in depth and release before the 30-day specified period if the individual remained at a constant depth (±2m) for 24 hours, which is assumed to indicate mortality). The first tag deployed (early in the morning) prematurely detached within 1 day. Given the sluggish nature of this species, and their tendency to rest during the day, it was deemed reasonable to modify the default settings to activate once the individual swam below 5 meters in depth and release before the specified period if the individual remained at a constant depth (±2m) for 48 hours. In addition, blood samples (5 ml) from XX individuals were taken from the caudal vein (Figure 8) and whole-blood lactate (a stress indicator) levels were measured with a handheld Lactate Pro 2 analyser (Arkray LT-1730).

### Socio-economic survey
A survey of TDGDLF vessel owners, skippers and fish processors was undertaken to understand the economic and social contribution of the TDGDLF to the WA community. The survey aimed to estimate what the combined benefit is to the local economy from TDGDLF operators. Information was also collected to compare the economic performance of demersal gillnet and demersal longlines. 
The socio-economic questionnaires (Tables A.8.1 and A.8.2) were designed in collaboration with socio-economists from the University of Western Australia following [@Pascoe2016].
A total of **XX** stake-holders were identified from **XX**. Initially, an e-mail was sent to each stake-holder followed by phone call inviting them take part of the survey. The importance of the participating in the survey was explained and a face to face meeting was arranged. **MISSING, to do Maddie**

Network analysis was used to visualize the destination of TDGDLF catch. **Here add calculations of GVP, etc. MISSING, explain calculations**


# Results

## Review of historical commercial catch and effort data

#### Catch composition by fishing method
The overall catch composition by method and zone is shown in figure 9. Gillnets contributed with the highest proportion of the total landed catch particularly in Zone 1, where only a small fraction of the catch was attributed to longlines. The most commoly-caught species in the west coast was sandbar shark, followed by dusky, spinner and whiskery sharks for gillnets and pink snapper followed by West Australian dhufish for longlines. When three vessels known to historically target scalefish were removed, the importance of pink snapper and West Australian dhufish in the longline catch declined considerably (Figure 10). The most commoly-caught species in Zone 1 was dusky shark, followed by whiskery, gummy and spinner sharks for gillnets and wobbegongs for longlines. The most commoly-caught species in Zone 2 was gummy shark, followed by whiskery, dusky and copper sharks for gillnets and gummy shark, followed by skates and rays and pink snapper for longlines.

The term method-zone explained 60% of the variation in the dissimilarity distances (Table 3), with all method-zone pairs showing significant differences (Table 4). The species characterising the main differences among method-zones are shown in Figure 12. There was a predominance of sandbar shark for gillnet-west and of pink snapper for longline-west. There was a predominance of gummy shark for gillnet-zone 2 and although gummy shark was also predominant for longline-zone 2, gurnards and pink snapper were also relatively important.

For gillnet-caught individuals, gummy shark (Tables A.1.3), whiskery shark (Table A.1.5), blue groper (Table A.1.9) and queen snapper (Table A.1.13) catch rates were significantly higher in Zone 2 than in the West coast whereas sandbar shark (Table A.1.6) and West Australian dhufish (Table.1.15) catch rates were significantly higher in the West coast than in Zone 2.
**ACA: pull out actual mean catch rate values for GN and LL (see page 13 Knuckey for gummy shark). Same for survey**
For longline-caught individuals, dusky shark (Table A.1.2) catch rates were significantly lower for Tuna-circle hooks (Figure 14). For gummy shark (Table A.1.4), catch rates were significantly higher in Zone 2 than in the West coast. For whiskery shark (Table A.1.6) and pink snapper (Table A.1.12), catch rates were significantly higher for Tuna-circle hooks (Figure 14). For sandbar shark (Table A.1.8) and West Australian dhufish (Table.1.16), catch rates significantly decreased with hook size (Figure 15). Finally for pink snapper (Table A.1.12) and West Australian dhufish (Table.1.16), catch rates were significantly lower in Zone 2 than in the West coast.

## Fishing survey

A total of **XX** fishing days (**XX** gillnet and **YY** longline shots) were done in the West coast (**X** fishing days) and Zones 1 (**X** fishing days) and 2 (**X** fishing days) of the South Coast.

**Four successful charter trips were conducted in SESSF waters across South Australia to trial the use of automatic longlines to target Gummy Shark (Table 4). Three trips took place during late spring / summer (November 2011 – January 2012), and the final trip was in June 2012. A total of 94 sets were observed, comprising about 150,000 hooks.**

#### Observed catch composition

# Discussion
**Notes from Steering Committee presentation:**
**3:1 ratio seems to be ok (shift in scalefish catch when moving away from 3:1 ratio)**
**Conclusion: inshore in West Coast, not achievable to use LL due to high catches of snapper; consider moving offshore to deeper waters; untapped resource, not fishable with nets**
