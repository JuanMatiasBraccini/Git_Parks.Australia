#### Image collection
##### Underwater cameras
Mono Gillnet, longline underwater video (GLUVs) were developed for this unique study. The GLUVs comprised one Sony FRD-x3000 action camera, mounted in an underwater housing. These housings were then attached to an aluminium bracket with shark clips to allow the cameras to be attached to different types of fishing gear. The GLUVs were made neutrally buoyant so they did not compromise the way the fishing gear would normally sit in the water. 10 GLUVs cameras that were attached to gillnets were angles at 45° to observe down the gillnet. Eight Cameras that were attached to the long line were positions to observe straight along the longline and were not angled. Each camera was attached to the fishing gear as it was deployed and recorded for the whole deployment of the fishing gear, averaging 4-6 hours on longlines and 6-8 on Gillnets. Cameras were randomly positioned but were separated by at least 50M.

##### Deck cameras
Two Sony FRD-x3000 action cameras were mounted in different locations around the different fishing vessels.  One camera was positioned at the measuring station. This camera allowed the identification of all fish that were caught and brought onboard the fishing vessels. The cameras also allowed the comparison of what was recorded by researchers out in the field, to what was able to be recorded on the cameras and analyses back on land. Finally, this position allowed the cameras to observe the amount of habitat caught in the fishing gear and brought on fishing vessels and allowed the quantification of habitat impact of the longlines and Gillnets.
A second deck camera was positioned above the retrieval roller of the vessel. One important area of research into the efficiency of fishing gear is the drop out rate and recovery of fish from the gillnet/longline. This angle allowed the researchers to record the number of animals that dropped out of the fishing gear when it is being retrieved and if the crew are able to recover it before it is lost entirely. This camera also allowed a closer view of how the sharks were caught in the net, weather they were caught by the gills or if they were tangled and bagged up. A last important function of this camera view was the counting of longline hooks. An important aspect of longlining that this project set out to untangle is where scale fish ad sharks were more likely to be caught on the longline weather height in the water column or closer to the sea floor. To determine this this camera could count if the hook the animal was caught on was closer the Weight (closer to the sea floor) or the pressure float (higher in the water column).

##### Subsurface camera

#### Image analyses
##### Underwater cameras
All video footage recorded on the vessels and the commercial fishing gear were downloaded onto external hard drives. The software ‘EventMeasure (Stereo)’ [@Seager2014] was then used in order analyse the video footage. Video images of the GLUVs were reviewed for both the maximum number of individuals of each species observed (MaxN) and for the interactions of fish with the two different fishing gear types.  Fish, sharks, and rays were identified down to the lowest taxonomic group possible by observers. To avoid repeatedly counting individual fish that continuously re-entering the cameras fields of view, the maximum number of individuals of the same species that appeared in the one frame at the same time (MaxN) was used to measure the relative abundance. MaxN allows for a conservative estimate of relative abundance. One limitation of video analysis with GLUVs was that occasionally it was not possible to identify species due to impaired visibility due to lighting or depth or a restricted field of view of the cameras. To mediate this, cameras were deployed when weather was good and visibility was above 3m, however if individual species could not be identified, species were grouped to Genus for maxN (These Genus include ADD IN LATER….)
Interactions with fishing gear were quantified based a several criteria (Table X). In the Event Measure program observers would categorise the interactions an animal had with the fishing gear. Example reference videos were made in order to standardise classification of individuals interactions. Finally, if a fish interacted by being caught on the fishing gear, the observer would time how long it was caught in the gear. This will allow us to understand the escape ration of animals that get caught by the fishing gear and their survival rates. If the fish is caught and landed then the time is still taken on how long it is in the net, to allow us to disentangle the effective soak times of the different fishing gear.

Information on benthic habitat structure and composition was assessed using the Transect Measure software. As each camera stayed stationary, one image on each camera along the gillnet and longline, was taken and analysed. To determine the benthic cover a virtual quadrat was placed over the seafloor that was visible in the image. Individually defining the quadrant this way allowed for the quadrats to be adaptive as every camera could have a different view and some should only be able to see a relatively small section of benthic habitat if it was tangled in the fishing gear during deployment. Within each quadrat 20 random points were overlayed over the benthic cover. Each point was categorised using the CATAMI guide [@Althaus2013]. Benthic cover was first classified into the following broad categories (LIST OF WHAT THEY WERE). These where then further broken down into finer categories of their morphological form (LIST OF THEM), health (LIST THEM) and condition (list them).


##### Deck cameras
Deck camera footage was analysed in Event Measure and analysed differently depending on the cameras position. For the camera in position one, above the measuring station, fish, sharks and rays were identified down to the lowest taxonomic group possible by video observers. Fish were identified once they were positioned on the measuring take to better compare the catch composition recorded by researchers on the boat to those recorded by the video observer. Video observers also noted the condition of the fish brought on board, weather it was alive or dead, and if the fish was retained or released.
To quantify the habitat damage of the fishing gear the camera in position one was used to quantify the percentage of the net that had habitat caught in it. The fishing gear was watched as it passed from the retrieval roller to the net roller and this distance was calculated for each vessel. Habitat was broken down into several variables which were Reef Structure, Sponge and Coral. These were then quantified into by percentage cover. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and Ecklonia radiata were also quantified, however due to current, and swell, small amounts seagrasses and macro algae could be caught in the nets that are suspended in the water column. As the aim was to determine damage small amounts of algae and seagrasses were ignored as it was unknown if their presence was actually damage. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and Ecklonia radiata were quantified in 5% intervals ignoring anything less than 10%.
For the deck camera that was in position two above the retrieval roller species were again identified to the lowest taxonomic number. When the gillnet was being retrieved how the fish were caught in the net was noted. Depending on how the net mesh was positioned around the fish it was categorised as either gilled, which meant that the net mesh had caught the fish around the gills, or if the fish was bagged, which meant that it had become tangled in the meshes. When the Longline was being retrieved, the position of the fish caught to either the floats or weights were recorded to determine any patterns on if the line caught more fish higher or lower in the water column. Between each float and weight (Depicted in Figure Matias image) hooks were counted, if the fish was caught within 3 hooks of a wight or float it was recorded. Lastly dropout was recoded for both gillnet and longline. If a fish dropped out of the net or longline this was recorded, as well as if the fish was recovered after it dropped out by the crew, via a gaff.

##### Subsurface camera
The video footage under the boat was used to identify species to the lowest taxonomic classification when possible.  Dropout was recorded to determine the amount of fish that were lost before the fishing gear was brought onto the boat. If the captured fish dropped out of the gear its retrieval by the crew was noted, as well as the fishes’ condition to determine the survival rate of captured fish on the fishing gear. For condition it was noted if the fish was health, alive and swum off or if it was dead.



#### Data analyses
For the most commonly-caught species, the size distribution obtained from gillnet and longline sampling were compared using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov D test and by estimating the area overlap of the kernel densities using the package overlapping.

Interpreting multivariate analysis in vegan
The R-square value is the important statistic for interpreting Adonis as it gives you the effect size. For example an R-squared of 0.44 means that 44% of the variation in distances is explained by the grouping being tested. The p value tells you whether or not this result was likely a result of chance. A p value of 0.05 means that there is a 5% chance that you detected a difference between groups (however large or small) when indeed there was none (the null hypothesis). As James said above, increasing your sample size tends to reduce p values. For example I have had a student recently come up with a significant difference (p<0.001) between groups with an R-squared of only 0.08 (8% of the variation).
You really should partner your Adonis analysis with an ordination or classification, here any divisions between groups will be visually apparent. Also you can undertake a SIMPER analysis to identify species (variables) that discriminate between groups. If you do have a strong difference then there should be a few species that are different between groups, if there is little difference then you won't find strong discriminatory species (variables).

## Discussion
Notes from Steering Committee presentation:
3:1 ratio seems to be ok (shift in scalefish catch when moving away from 3:1 ratio)
Conclusion: inshore in West Coast, not achievable to use LL due to high catches of snapper; consider moving offshore to deeper waters; untapped resource, not fishable with nets
