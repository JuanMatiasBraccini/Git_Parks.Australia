# Executive summary
The Temperate Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fisheries (TDGDLF) are one of the main commercial shark fisheries in Australia. Fishers in the TDGDLF employ mostly demersal gillnets to target sharks with scalefish taken as byproduct. Demersal longlines are also permitted but are not widely used. Gillnets are size selective but they do not necessarily discriminate among species, catching target and non-target species. 

The current project addressed key issues relating to the use of gillnet and longlines by TDGDLF fishers. There were three parts to this project, (i) a desktop study, (ii) a 55-day field study using onboard observers and cameras mounted on demersal gillnets and demersal longlines, and (iii) a socio-economic survey.

Demersal gillnets and demersal longlines had relatively different species compositions; although most of the main commercial species were captured by both fishing methods, they have done so in different proportions. Similarly, catch rates varied by fishing method. Dropout rates were low for both fishing methods, particularly for commercial species. Despite the popular perception of gillnets being ‘indiscriminate walls of death’, the most commonly observed behaviour by underwater cameras was ‘swim past’. The majority of discarded individuals were released in good condition. Electronic and onboard observer monitoring showed very similar catch compositions. Demersal gillnets were mostly set on coarse sand and to a lower extent, macroalgae, and had very limited damage on the different habitats where deployed. 

Most of the catch landed by fishers is sold to processors, who, in turn, sell most of the processed catch to local retailers and direct to public, and a lesser extent export the catch interstate. The TDGDLF employs up to 150 persons and has an overall annual market value through the supply chain of up to AUD $20 million, considerably larger than its GVP. The information collected in this study challenges the financial feasibility of manually-baited demersal longlines, which require longer working hours, incur in bait losses and may result in lower shark catch rates due to monofilament bite-offs.
 

# Introduction
The Temperate Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Fisheries (TDGDLF) comprise of the West Coast Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline (Interim) Managed Fishery (WCDGDLF), which operates between 26° and 33° S, and the Southern Demersal Gillnet and Demersal Longline Managed Fishery (SDGDLF), which operates from 33° S to the Western Australian (WA)/South Australian (SA) border (Figure 1).

Fishers in the TDGDLF employ mostly demersal gillnets to target sharks with scalefish taken as byproduct. Demersal longline is also permitted but is not widely used. Whilst gillnets are used worldwide to catch a range of species and are considered size selective, they do not necessarily discriminate among species, catching target and non-target species and as such have been labelled indiscriminate ‘walls of death’ (e.g., The West Australian, 26 September 2012). Additionally, sectors of the public and many environmental non-governmental organisations (eNGO) consider the incidental catch of endangered, threatened and protected (ETP) species (e.g., marine birds, mammals and turtles) unacceptable, even if sustainability risk to those populations is negligible.

The introduction of Australian Sea Lion Gillnet Exclusion Zones (ASL Zones) and the 
South-west Australian Marine Park Network in mid-2018 has excluded areas to demersal gillnets, significantly reducing the area traditionally fished by operators in the TDGDLF. This is especially evident in zone 2 of the SDGDLF and the WCDGDLF. In response to this, the Western Australian Fishing Industry Council (WAFIC) received funding from Parks Australia as part of the Australian Government’s Our Marine Parks Grants Program to undertake research aimed at informing the future management of the TDGDLF. This project was funded as part of the grants program under the direction of a steering group consisting of the Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD), WAFIC and the Southern Seafood Producers Association (SSPA).

The objective of this project is to address key issues and questions relating to the use of gillnet and longlines by TDGDLF fishers. Specifically, to gain a better understanding of changes in fishing efficiency (required for allowing unbiased stock assessments), catch composition (sharks and scalefish), and impacts on habitat and ETP species from the use of demersal gillnets or demersal longlines. The final objective of the project is to better understand the social and economic contributions of the TDGDLF to the WA community.

The project had three phases:

* Phase one involved a desktop study reviewing current knowledge of fishing methods used in the TDGDLF; 
* Phase two involved data collection through a chartered fishing survey comparing catch composition, catch rates, and habitat impacts of demersal gillnets and longlines using both onboard observer (OM) and electronic monitoring (EM); and
* Phase three involved a socio-economic study of TDGDLF fishers and processors. 

# Methods

## Phase one - Review of available commercial catch and effort data

### Data collection
A desktop study was done to review available information on the use of demersal gillnet and demersal longline in the TDGDLF, with a focus on catch composition, interactions with ETP species, broader ecosystem impacts and historical change for the two gear types. Data were obtained from the literature and DPIRD’s catch and effort systems. Catch and effort data were extracted from monthly returns (catch and effort records reported between 1975-76 and 2005-06) and daily logbooks (catch and effort records reported since 2006-07). Scalefish records are only available since 1988-89 so comparisons of catch composition and multivariate analyses were done using records starting in 1988-89.

### Data analyses
Data manipulation and analyses were done using the statistical package R [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2014]. 
Differences in the overall (i.e. all financial years, vessels and blocks within a zone combined, Figure 3) catch composition of gillnets and longlines were tested with multivariate statistics using the package *vegan*. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) on proportional data and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities was used to collapse the multivariate species composition into two dimensions. PERMANOVA (function *Adonis*) was used to test for significant differences between fishing methods and fishing zone, fitted as a combined term 'method-zone'. Similarity Percentage Analysis (SIMPER) was used to determine the contribution of each species to the dissimilarity among method-zones. For the multivariate analyses of daily logbooks, Zone 1 was excluded due to the historically low number of longline records. Also, for daily logbooks, the multivariate analyses were repeated removing three fishing vessels from the daily logbooks known to historically target scalefish in the West coast and for a subset of more comparable records where only records from the same spatial block–financial year–month were selected.

Catch rates were standardised for the main commercial shark and scalefish species and each fishing method separately. The standardisation was done using generalised linear models (GLMs) with catch rate as response variable (kg per 1 m hour or 1 hook hour for gillnets and longlines, respectively) and fishing zone and vessel as terms for the gillnet model, and fishing zone, vessel, hook type and hook size as terms for the longline model. Fishing zone, hook type and hook size were fitted as factors and vessel was fitted as a random term. A Tweedie distribution with a log link was used considering the relatively high proportion of records with zero catch. Only daily logbooks were used for catch rate standardisations due to higher resolution of the data.


## Phase two - Fishing survey
### Commercial fishing vessel chartering and onboard observer program
Three TDGDLF gillnet fishing vessels were chartered to fish with gillnets and longlines simultaneously. The process for selecting suitable vessels for participation in the fieldwork component first involved discussions with all commercial licence holders in the TDGDLF. DPIRD staff then met with licence holders and active operators who had expressed interest. Five operators were then deemed suitable, however due to external circumstances, only three participated in the project. 

The three operators were distributed across the WCDGDLF and Zone 1 and Zone 2 of the SDGDLF, providing the ability for robust data collection. The specific selection of each trip length was determined by vessel size, capacity to accommodate the additional research staff and equipment, and experience in operating across the different fishing zones. The order for vessel chartering was determined to optimise timeframes for data collection whilst considering vessel availability and logistical constraints.

Sampling followed standard commercial fishing operations with skippers allowed to choose when and where the gear was set. Demersal gillnets were supplied by each fisher and had the same configuration used in TDGDLF standard commercial operations (i.e. monofilament webbing with a mesh size of 6.5 inches) as per described in [@McAuley2003a] and [@McAuley2007a], but with a length of up to 3000 m. 

The demersal longline was ~1500 m long and comprised of ~240 hooks of different size (10/0, 12/0 and 14/0) and shape (tuna circle hooks and Ezi-baiter) attached to the main line (8 mm diameter) via ~60 cm stainless steel wire rope (2 mm diameter 7x7 grade stainless steel coated with PVC) or monofilament (1.8 mm diameter) snoods (Figure 2). Approximately 20 of each combination of snood type, hook type and hook size were used per gear deployment. Each hook was manually baited with squid, octopus, mullet, whiting, herring or pilchards. Approximately 10 snoods were clipped to the main line between each weight and pressure float to allow sampling close to the bottom and into the water column. 

Demersal gillnets were deployed for between 0.7 and 23.4 hours (mean=12.2 hours) and demersal longlines were deployed for betweem 0.8 and 20.8 hours (mean=10.9 hours). A tori line was used to minimize seabird-longline interactions during longline deployments. Depending on vessel configuration, longlines were set either by using the gillnet reel or a small dedicated longline reel. Once the first longline weight and float were deployed, the vessel steamed slowly forward and the crew and staff clipped the snoods onto the line at roughly 5m intervals. Floats and weights were set in an alternating fashion with either a float or weight attached to the longline after every 10 hooks (50 m, Figure 2); however, this was up to the fisher’s discretion and one elected to use two weights then a float to keep their longline lower in the water column. Longlines were retrieved using the gillnet retrieval roller and winch. As the lines were retrieved the hook and snoods were unclipped and hung for baiting for the next deployment. The retrieval winch could be stopped easily to unclip caught animals or tangled hooks.

Two to three scientific observers were on board each vessel and collected data on GPS location, depth, date, time and catch composition for each observed shot, which were conducted in the West and South Coast Bioregions (Figure 3) between July 2020 and September 2021 in depths of 9–102 m. Each individual fish caught was identified to the highest taxonomic resolution possible, measured (fork and total length for sharks, disc width for southern eagle rays/stingrays and total length for scalefish) and recorded as retained or discarded by the fisher. Sharks and rays were also sexed and, for the main commercial shark species, vertebrae (n=157 dusky shark; n=87 gummy shark; n=71 whiskery shark; n=8 sandbar shark) were collected from the anterior part of the trunk for future ageing analysis and construction of catch age compositions. Discarded individuals were assigned a release condition classed as 0 (dead), 1 (individual swam off strongly and did not remain at the surface), 2 (individual swam off moderately strongly and typically swam at the surface for a period), or 3 (individual swam off in poor condition or did not appear to swim) [@MatiasBraccini2019].

#### Data analyses
A similar approach to the Phase 1 analyses was adopted to test for the effects of fishing gear and zone on catch composition and for the standardisation of catch rates for the main commercial species. In addition, for the most commonly caught species, the size distributions obtained from gillnet and longline sampling were compared using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov D test and by estimating the area overlap of the kernel densities using the package *overlapping*. In addition, a GLM model was constructed with size as response variable and fishing zone and gear as model terms. A normal distribution was assumed. For longline-caught fish, a model was also constructed to test the effect of hook size, hook type and snood type on mean size. A GLM with a binomial distribution was used to test for differences between gillnets and longlines in the probability of retaining an individual.

Hook size selectivity for circular and Ezi-Baiter hooks was estimated from longline-caught fish using the SELECT (share each length’s catch total) method developed by [@Millar1997] available through the package *gillnetfunctions*. The SELECT method considers normal, gamma or lognormal distributions so the ‘best curve’ was determined based on the deviance explained. Only species with at least 30 size observations per hook size were considered for this analysis.    

### Image collection
#### Underwater cameras
Mono gillnet, longline underwater video systems (GLUVs) were developed for this unique study. The GLUVs comprised one Sony FRD-x3000 action camera, mounted in an underwater housing. These housings were attached to an aluminum bracket with shark clips. This allowed the camera housing to be attached to the gillnet and longline mainline (Figure 4). The GLUVs were made neutrally buoyant to avoid compromising the way the fishing gear would normally sit in the water column. Ten GLUVs  were attached to the gillnets with a 45° angle to observe down the gillnet. Eight GLUVs were attached to the longline; these cameras were not angled to observe straight along the longline. Each camera was attached to the fishing gear for the duration of the gear being set in the water, ranging between 4–6 hours for longlines and 6–8 hours for gillnets. GLUVs were only deployed during the day and  were randomly positioned but separated by at least 50m.

<br>

#### Deck cameras
Two Sony FRD-x3000 action cameras were mounted in two different locations around the deck of the fishing vessels (Figure 5). Deck camera 1 was positioned above the wheelhouse pointing towards the deck where fish were measured and processed. This camera allowed the (i) identification of all fish caught and brought onboard and (ii) the quantification of habitat caught in fishing gear and brought onboard as a relative measure of habitat impact.

Deck camera 2 was positioned above the retrieval roller of the vessel. The position of this camera recorded (i) the number of individuals that came onboard, (ii) the number that dropped out and if they were retrieved by crew members before being lost, and (iii) the position of longline-caught fish relative to a weight (i.e. caught closer to the sea floor) or pressure float (i.e. caught higher in the water column) to infer their relative position in the water column. 

Deck cameras 1 and 2 allowed the comparison of what was recorded by onboard observers and the video footage recorded by the cameras.

<br>

#### Subsurface camera
One Sony FRD-x3000 action camera was mounted to a long pole that attached to the gunwale of the different fishing boats. The pole was long enough to keep the camera roughly 1m under the surface of the water. This camera was set up close to where the fishing gear was retrieved onto the boat and was angled to capture the fishing gear just below the surface (Figure 6). This camera was deployed for the duration of the longline and gillnet retrieval and was angled to allow observing species dropout and condition in addition to any animal attracted to the fishing gear but not caught in it.

### Image analyses
#### Underwater cameras
All video footage was downloaded onto external hard drives and analysed back in the lab using the software ‘EventMeasure (Stereo)’ [@Seager2014]. Video images from the GLUVs were reviewed for both the maximum number of individuals of each species observed (MaxN) and for the type of observed behaviour (Table 1). Example reference videos were made in order to standardise classification of the behaviour types recorded in Event Measure.

All observed individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level. To avoid repeatedly counting individual fish that continuously re-entered the cameras fields of view, the maximum number of individuals of the same species that appeared in the one frame at the same time (MaxN) was used as a measure of relative abundance. MaxN allows for a conservative estimate of relative abundance. One limitation of video analysis with GLUVs was that occasionally it was not possible to identify species due to impaired visibility due to lighting, depth or a restricted field of view of the cameras. If an individual species could not be determined, species were grouped to Genus or Family level.

Information on benthic habitat structure and composition was collected using the Transect Measure software. As each camera stayed stationary, only one image per camera needed to be analysed. To determine benthic cover a virtual quadrat was placed over the seafloor that was visible in the image. Individually defining the quadrant this way allowed for the quadrats to be adaptive as every camera could have a different view and some should only be able to see a relatively small section of benthic habitat if it was tangled in the fishing gear during deployment. Within each quadrat 20 random points were overlayed over the benthic cover. Each point was categorised using the CATAMI guide [@Althaus2013]. Benthic cover was classified into different categories based on morphological form and condition (Table 2, Figure 7).

#### Deck cameras
Deck camera footage was analysed in Event Measure according to camera position. For deck camera 1, all individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level. Fish were identified once they were positioned on the measuring table to better compare the catch composition recorded by onboard observed with those recorded by the video analyst. Video analysts also noted the condition of each individual brought on board, whether it was alive or dead, retained or released and for gillnets, whether it was gilled (i.e. the net mesh had caught the fish around the gills) or bagged (i.e. the fish had become tangled in the net). 

For deck camera 2, individuals were also identified to the lowest taxonomic level. For longline-caught individuals, the position of fish caught in relation to the closest pressure float or weight (Figure 2) was recorded to calculate the relative position of the caught-fish in the water column. Finally, dropout and gaffing events were also recorded.

To quantify relative habitat damage by gillnets, the percentage of habitat cover in the net was quantified. To achieve this, onboard observers measured the distance of the net that was captured on the deck cameras field of view (i.e. between the retrieval roller and the main gillnet roller). Once this was known, video analysts calculated the percentage of the net section that passed through the cameras line of sight with habitat tangled in. 

Habitat was classified into several categories: Reef Structure, Sponge and Coral, which were quantified into percentage cover. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and *Ecklonia radiata* were also quantified, however, due to current, and swell, seagrass and macro algae could be caught in the nets while suspended in the water column. As the aim was to determine habitat damage, small amounts of algae and seagrasses were ignored as it was unknown if their presence in the net was due to actual gear damage to habitats or due to seagrass or algae being caught while floating in the water column. Seagrasses, Macroalgae and *Ecklonia radiata* were quantified in 5% intervals starting from 10%.


#### Subsurface camera
For the subsurface camera individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level and dropout events recorded. If captured individuals dropped out of the gear its retrieval by the crew was noted (gaffing events), as well as the individual’s condition (dead or alive). 

#### Data analyses
The multivariate statistics described in Phase 1 were applied to compare the behaviour types derived from underwater cameras by taxonomic group (sharks, rays, scalefish, invertebrates). For the most commonly caught species, a GLM with a binomial distribution was used to test for differences between gillnets and longlines in the probability of dropouts and of capture near a weight or pressure float (longline-caught fish only). Dropout rates were calculated for the information collected from deck camera 2, subsurface and underwater cameras whereas depredation (both fishing methods) and bait loss rates (longline only) were calculated from the underwater cameras.

### Observer monitoring vs electronic monitoring
To measure the congruence between EM and OM, the catch composition (number of individuals per species) reported by onboard observers was compared to that obtained from the analysis of video footage collected by deck cameras 1 and 2. A GLM was constructed where the response variable was the count of individuals from EM and predictors were the count of individuals from OM and fishing gear [@Emery2019]. The OM coefficient and the intercept are expected to follow a 1:1 relationship (slope of 1 and intercept of 0).  Differences in reporting by individual species were determined by calculating the percentage difference between OM and EM. This was calculated as the difference between the number of individuals of a given species reported by EM and by OM divided by the number of individuals of that species with the greatest number.


### Satellite tagging and blood sampling
Port Jackson sharks, *Heterodontus portusjacksoni*, are by far the most-commonly discarded elasmobranch in the TDGDLF [@McAuley2003a]. This species is very robust and has very low at-deck post-capture mortality when caught in demersal gillnets [@Braccini2012]. Indirect methods suggest a very high post-release survival (PRS). However, these findings have not been validated. Satellite tagging allows the ultimate validation of PRS as it integrates the effects of catch and release physiological stress and post-release predation. To provide a quantitative validation of Port Jackson shark's PRS, 6 randomly chosen individuals caught in demersal gillnets were fitted with survivorship pop-up archival transmitting (sPAT) tags (Model MK10, Wildlife Computers Inc., Figure 8) tethered to a nylon intramuscular anchor inserted at the base of the dorsal fin. The tags are designed to record depth, temperature and light information, which was archived at 24-hour intervals for the entire deployment period, and ten-minute intervals for the last five days of deployment. 

The tags were programmed to detach and transmit data to the ARGOS satellite system after a 30-day deployment. Initially, the default settings were maintained (i.e. activate once the individual swam below 10 meters in depth and release before the 30-day specified period if the individual remained at a constant depth (±2m) for 24 hours, which is assumed to indicate mortality). The first tag deployed (early in the morning) prematurely detached within 1 day. Given the sluggish nature of this species, and their tendency to rest during the day, it was deemed reasonable to modify the default settings to activate once the individual swam below 5 meters in depth and release before the specified period if the individual remained at a constant depth (±2m) for 48 hours. 

In addition, blood samples (5 ml) from 22 individuals were taken from the caudal vein (Figure 9) and the concentration of whole-blood lactate (a stress indicator) was measured with a hand-held Lactate Pro 2 analyser (Arkray LT-1730).

## Phase three - Socio-economic survey
A survey of TDGDLF vessel owners, skippers and fish processors was undertaken to understand the economic and social contribution of the TDGDLF to the WA community. The survey aimed to estimate what the combined benefit is to the local economy from the TDGDLF. Information was also collected to compare the economic performance of demersal gillnet and demersal longlines. 
Two socio-economic questionnaires (Tables A.8.1 and A.8.2) were designed [@Pascoe2016]. A total of 46 stakeholders were originally identified from DPIRD’s licensing, VMS and catch and effort returns databases. 33 fishers and/or fish processors were then identified as ‘active operators’ and an email was sent to each notifying them of the upcoming survey. Each stakeholder was then followed up with a phone call from DPIRD staff. The importance of participating in the survey was explained and a face-to-face meeting was arranged with those who agreed to participate.

Network analysis and Sankey plots were used to visualize the flow of the TDGDLF catch for the fisher and processor sectors. 

### Comparison of demersal gillnet and demersal longline economic performance
To compare the economics of demersal gillnets and longlines, the relative performance of demersal longlines, $RP_{longline}$, was calculated as follows:
$$RP_{longline}= \frac{R_{g=longline}-C_{g=longline}}{R_{g=gillnet}-C_{g=gillnet}}$$
where $R_{g}$ is the revenue generated from landing one tonne of fish by fishing method $g$; and $C_{g}$ is the corresponding costs by fishing method $g$.

The revenue from landing one tonne of fish by fishing method $g$ was calculated as follows:
$$R_{g}=K_{i,g} p_{i,g} 1000$$
where $K_{i,g}$ is the proportion of species $i$ in the catch composition of fishing method $g$, obtained from the catch and effort returns; $p_{i,g}$ is the price per kg of species $i$ by fishing method $g$, obtained from the socio-economic survey.

The cost of landing one tonne of fish by fishing method $g$ was calculated as follows:
$$C_{g}=N_{g} (c_{crew,g}+c_{gear,g}+c_{bait,g=longline})$$
where $N_{g}$ is the number of fishing days required to land one tonne of fish by fishing method $g$; $c_{crew,g}$ is the daily cost for crew; $c_{gear,g}$ is the daily cost for gear repairs; and $c_{bait,g=longline}$ is the daily cost of bait for demersal longlines. Other costs cancel out. $c_{crew,g}$, $c_{gear,g}$ and $c_{bait,g=longline}$ were obtained from the fishers chartered for the fieldwork component of this project. 

Catch and effort returns from daily logbooks were used to estimate $N_{g}$. Monthly returns were not considered as comparisons between fishing methods required daily information whereas monthly returns aggregate multiple fishing days into a single record. The vast majority (>97%) of the daily catch and effort records are for single shots. Hence, a GAM was used to estimate a standardised average landed catch per shot. The response variable was the log of the reported landed catch. Model terms considered were vessel, month, spatial block, depth, soak time, and number of hooks (longline only) or net length (gillnet only). Vessel and spatial block were fitted as factors whereas depth, month and soak time were fitted as smoothing splines. To determine the average number of fishing days (with 95% CI) required to land one tonne of fish, the estimated average landed catch for the most commonly used net length (4000 m) and soak time (4 hours for longlines, 8 hours for gillnets) was assumed. For longlines, we assumed the deployment of 1000 hooks, which is the number of hooks that fishers chartered for the fieldwork component of this project would use if they were to solely fish with longlines. Under this assumption, fishers can deploy gillnets twice a day but longlines only once a day given the considerable amount of time taken to bait hooks manually (N.B. the average baiting time during the fieldwork component of the survey was ~95 hooks per person per hour whereas a baiting board designed by one of the charter fishers allowed baiting 300 hooks in 1.5 hours per person). Therefore, we considered a scenario (S1) where fishers could improve hook-baiting time through automatic baiting and assumed two deployments of 1000 hooks each per day. Hence, the estimated landed catch per shot was multiplied by two for demersal gillnets and the S1 demersal longline scenario to calculate the total landed catch per day. The parameter values used in the calculations of are shown in Table A.9.1.


### Valuing the TDGDLF
Catch and socio-economic survey data were used to determine the social and economic contribution of the TDGDLF based the following indicators: the gross value of end consumptive use, which represents the market value through the supply chain [@Rogers2017a], the Gross Value Added (GVA), and the number of persons employed in the TDGDLF. The Gross Value of Production (GVP) was not included as an economic indicator of fishery importance as it undervalues the contribution to the domestic economy from fisheries such as the TDGDLF, which are domestically-based and products consumed within Australia, compared to export-based fisheries [@Rogers2017a].

#### Market value through supply chain
The overall market value through the supply chain of the TDGDLF, $FV$, was calculated as follows:
$$FV=PV_{retail}\ p_{sold\ retail} + FCV\ p_{sold\ FC} + PV_{wholesale}\ p_{sold\ wholesale} $$
where $PV_{retail}$ is the revenue generated by processors for retail sales; $p_{sold\ retail}$ is the proportion of the processed catch from the TDGDLF sold as retail; $FCV$ is the revenue generated by fish and chip shops from the sale of processed TDGDLF catch; $p_{sold\ FC}$ is the proportion of the processed catch from the TDGDLF sold to fish & chip shops; $PV_{wholesale}$ is the revenue generated by processors for wholesale sales other than fish & chips shops; and $p_{sold\ wholesale}$ is the proportion of the processed catch from the TDGDLF sold as wholesale other than fish & chip shops. 

The revenue generated by each sector was calculated as follows:
$$PV_{retail}=\sum\limits_{i=1}p_{ri} \bar{l_{i}} r_{i}$$
where $p_{ri}$ is the processors' retail price (fillets) per kg for species $i$; $\bar{l_{i}}$ is the average annual landed catch from the TDGDLF for species $i$; and $r_{i}$ is the flesh recovery rate of species $i$, set at 0.7 for shark trunks, 0.06 for shark belly flaps and 0.35 for scalefish [@Rogers2017a].

$$PV_{wholesale}=\sum\limits_{i=1}p_{wi} \bar{l_{i}} r_{i}$$
where $p_{wi}$ is the processors' wholesale price (fillets) per kg for species $i$.

$$FCV=\sum\limits_{i=1}pf_{ci} \bar{l_{i}} r_{i}$$
where $pf_{ci}$ is the fish and chips price (fillets) per kg for species $i$.

Information on $\bar{l_{i}}$ was extracted from DPIRD’s catch and effort systems. The average for the financial years 2014-15 to 2018-19 was used. The year 2019-20 was omitted because fishing dynamics, and hence landings, were affected by COVID19. The proportion of the processed catch sold by processors, $p_{sold}$, to the retail (0.35), fish and chip shops (0.375) and other wholesale (0.275) sectors was obtained from the socio-economic survey.
For processors, retail and wholesale prices, $p_{ri}$ and $p_{wi}$, were obtained from the survey. For species not accounted for in the questionnaire, species-specific  prices were set to the price of ‘other sharks’ or ‘other teleost’ reported in the socio-economic survey.
For the fish & chips sector, the price per fillet was obtained from an online search of menus from Western Australian fish & chip shops (164  shops). The price per kg, $pf_{ci}$, was reconstructed using an average fillet weight of 150g [@Rogers2017a]. Based on the website search five type of labels were used to advertise shark fillets: ‘gummy shark’, ‘bronze whaler’, ‘whiskery shark’, ‘sandbar shark’, and ‘shark’. The average price of ‘shark’ was used for the calculations of all shark species other than gummy, dusky (bronze whaler), whiskery and sandbar sharks. For scalefish, fillet price information from online menus of fish & chip shops was only available for pink snapper, hence, the multipliers developed by [@Rogers2017a] for pink snapper, hapuku, blue groper, and Nannygai were used to scale the beach prices to final point of sale prices. These multipliers take into account the increase in value through the supply chain and were developed by Rogers (2017) in consultation with the fishing industry. For scalefish species not accounted for by [@Rogers2017a], an overall multiplier of 3.3 was used.
For species not accounted for in the questionnaire, species-specific prices were obtained from the beach price information annually collected by The Department. To account for variability in fish prices within each sector, the minimum and maximum values were used to provide a range of $FV$.

#### Gross Value Added
The GVA of the TDGDLF was calculated as follows:
$$GVA=R - C + T + W$$
where $R$ is the annual revenue generated by the TDGDLF; $C$ is the annual costs incurred by the TDGDLF; $T$ is the annual taxes payed by the TDGDLF; and $W$ are the annual wages paid by the TDGDLF.

$$R=\sum\limits_{i=1}pf_{i} \bar{l_{i}}$$
where $pf_{i}$ is the price paid to TDGDLF fishers per kg for species $i$ (trunks for sharks, whole fish for scalefish).

$$C=c\  n_{TDGDLF}$$
where $c$ is the annual costs (minimum and maximum) incurred by an average boat operating in the TDGDLF (vessel and gear repairs and maintenance, vessel lease/mortgage, fuel and lubricants, food, packaging, ice, administration), obtained from the socio-economic survey; and $n_{TDGDLF}$ is the total number of fishing vessels operating in the TDGDLF, obtained from the Department's databases.


$$T=t\  n_{TDGDLF}$$
where $t$ is the annual tax (minimum and maximum) paid by an average boat operating in the TDGDLF, obtained from the socio-economic survey.

$$W=w\  n_{TDGDLF}$$
where $w$ is the annual wages (minimum and maximum) paid by an average boat operating in the TDGDLF, obtained from the socio-economic survey.


#### Employment
The total annual number of FTEs (full-time employees) directly employed in the TDGDLF was obtained from the Department's catch and effort returns. The total annual number of employees (full-time and part-time) working in the TDGDLF was calculated as follows:
$$E_{TDGDLF}=s_{TDGDLF}\  n_{TDGDLF}$$
where $E_{TDGDLF}$ is the annual number of persons employed in the TDGDLF; $s_{TDGDLF}$ is the number (minimum and maximum) of persons employed per vessel in the TDGDLF, obtained from the socio-economic survey.

## Review of historical information

### Commercial catch and effort
#### Catch composition by fishing method
##### Overall records
The overall catch composition by method and zone is shown in Figures 10 and 11 for monthly returns and daily logbooks, respectively. For monthly returns, gillnet landings were orders of magnitude larger than longline landings. The most commonly landed species in the WCDGDLF were dusky and sandbar sharks, followed by whiskery, ‘other’ and wobbegong sharks for both fishing methods (Figure 10).

In the SDGDLF, the most commonly landed species in Zone 1 was dusky shark, followed by whiskery shark for gillnets and skates and rays, followed by ‘other’ and dusky shark for longlines. The most commonly landed species in Zone 2 was gummy shark, followed by dusky and whiskery sharks for both fishing methods, and pink snapper and hapuku for longlines and school shark for gillnets.

<br>

For daily logbooks, gillnets contributed with the highest proportion of the total landed catch particularly in Zone 1 of the SDGDLF, where only a small fraction of the catch was attributed to longlines (Figure 11). The most commonly landed species in the WCDGDLF was sandbar shark, followed by dusky, spinner and whiskery sharks for gillnets and pink snapper followed by West Australian dhufish for longlines. When three vessels known to have historically targeted demersal scalefish were removed, the importance of pink snapper and West Australian dhufish in the longline catch declined considerably (Figure 12). 

In the SDGDLF, the most commonly landed species in Zone 1 was dusky shark, followed by whiskery, gummy and spinner sharks for gillnets and wobbegongs for longlines, although as mentioned above, the longline catch in Zone 1 was negligible (~0.1 tonnes since 2006-07). The most commonly landed species in Zone 2 was gummy shark, followed by whiskery, dusky and copper sharks for gillnets and gummy shark, followed by skates and rays and pink snapper for longlines.

Species composition differed among zones and fishing methods with the nMDS showing a clear separation between Zone 2 and the other zones for monthly returns (Figure 13) and between Zone 2 and the WCDGDLF for daily logbooks, noting that Zone 1 was not considered in the daily logbook analysis due to very small sample sizes (Figure 14).

The term method-zone explained 56% and 60% of the variation in the dissimilarity distances for monthly returns (Table 3) and daily logbooks (Table 4), respectively. All method-zone pairs showed significant differences for the two data sets (Tables 5 and 6).

For monthly returns, the species characterising the main differences among method-zones are shown in Figure 15 and Table 7. For the WCDGDLF, there was a higher percentage of wobbegongs, alfonsinos and pink snapper caught with longlines than for gillnets. 

In the SDGDLF, for Zone 1, there was a higher percentage of dusky and whiskery sharks caught with gillnets compared to longlines and more alfonsinos caught with longlines than gillnets. For Zone 2, gummy shark was more dominant in gillnet catches than in longlines whereas pink snapper was more dominant  in longline catch than in gillnets.

##### Comparable records
For directly comparable records (i.e. those reported for the same financial year, month and block), the catch composition by method and zone is shown in Figures 17 and 18 for monthly returns and daily logbooks, respectively. 

For monthly returns, all comparable records (blocks 30140, 31150, 32150) occurred in the WCDGDLF. The most commonly landed species by demersal gillnets were sandbar, dusky, whiskery, copper and spinner sharks, whereas the most commonly landed species by demersal longlines were pink snapper, West Australian dhufish, and sandbar and wobbegong sharks (Figure 17).

<br>

For daily logbooks, comparable records occurred in the WCDGDLF (blocks 292141, 295145) and SDGDLF Zone 2 (blocks 343191, 350180, 350181). The demersal gillnet and demersal longline catch composition was more similar in SDGDLF Zone 2 than in the WCDGDLF, where a considerably higher proportion of scalefish was caught by demersal longlines (Figure 18).

#### Catch rates for the main commercial species by fishing method

For the main commercial species, the distribution of catch rates by method and zone is shown Figure 19 and the standardised catch rates are shown in Figures 20 and 21 and Appendix 1.

<br>

It must be noted that demersal gillnet and demersal longline catch rates are not directly comparable due to differing effort units but overall patterns can be inferred. For gummy sharks, standardised longline catch rates in Zone 2 of the SDGDLF were considerably higher than for the other gear-zones whereas for sandbar shark, pink snapper and West Australian dhufish, standardised longline catch rates in the WCDGDLF were considerably higher than for the other gear-zones (Figure 20).

<br>

For gillnet-caught individuals, the standardized catch rates of gummy shark (Table A.1.3), whiskery shark (Table A.1.5), blue groper (Table A.1.9) and queen snapper (Table A.1.13) were significantly higher in Zone 2 of SDGDLF than in the WCDGDLF. Whereas the standardised catch rates of sandbar shark (Table A.1.6) and West Australian dhufish (Table.1.15) were significantly higher in the WCDGDLF than in Zone 2 of the SDGDLF.

For longline-caught individuals with Tuna-circle hooks, the standardised catch rates were significantly lower for dusky shark, but significantly higher for whiskery shark (Table A.1.6) and pink snapper (Table A.1.12). For sandbar shark (Table A.1.8) and West Australian dhufish (Table.1.16), standardised catch rates significantly decreased with hook size (Figure 22). In Zone 2 of the SDGDLF, standardised catch rates were significantly higher for gummy shark (Table A.1.4), but significantly lower for West Australian dhufish (Table A.1.16) compared to the WCDGDLF.

The annual number of vessels using demersal gillnet and demersal longline and the average catch per vessel is shown in Figure 25. For all zones and methods, the number of vessels operating in the TDGDLF peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s and substantially decreased with time. In contrast, the average annual catch per vessel increased with time for the vessels that continued operating in the TDGDLF.

The annual number of fishing days for demersal gillnet and demersal longline and the average annual number of fishing days by vessel is shown in Figure 26. As for the number of vessels, the number of fishing days by gear-zone peaked in the late 1980s and early 1990s and substantially decreased with time. In contrast, the average annual number of fishing days increased with time for the vessels that continued operating in the TDGDLF.

#### Type, size and number of hooks used
For vessels using longlines, a wide range of hook sizes were used but most records reported the use of 14/0 hooks (Figure 27). Both Ezi-baiter and Tuna-circle hooks were used but the majority of records reported the use of Tuna-circle hooks (Figure 28). Finally, a wide range of number of hooks were reported with most records reporting between 300 and 900 hooks per session (Figure 29).

#### Soak time by fishing method
The reported soak time for gillnets and longlines is shown in Figure 30. Overall, gillnets were soaked for longer periods, showing two peaks at ~ 6-8 and 24 hours, respectively. Longlines, in turn, showed a single peak at 4-5 hours.

### Broader ecosystem impacts

#### Interactions with Endangered, Threatened and Protected Species
The West Coast and South Coast Bioregions are home to several marine species protected under international agreements and national or state legislation. An interaction is considered to be any physical contact between a person, fishing vessel or fishing gear, and an Endangered, Threatened and Protected (ETP) species (DPIRD 2021). TDGDLF fishers are required to report interactions with ETP species in their statutory fishing returns (since 2005-06).
An on-board observer program run between 1994-1999 across the entire distribution of the TDGDLF (observer coverage of 7.4% of total effort), found a low interaction rate between demersal gillnets and ETP species [@McAuley2003a]. Marine mammals were caught at a rate of 1 capture per 10,000 km gn.hours, seabirds at 4 captures per 100,000 km gn.hours and turtles at 1 capture per 100,000 km gn.hours [@McAuley2003a].

The potential of Australian Sea Lion (ASL) entanglement in demersal gillnets is an identified threat to the recovery of the species[@DSEWPaC2013]. In 2018, DPIRD implemented a science-based network of ASL gillnet exclusion zones in the waters of the TDGDLF. In total, 33 exclusion zones are in place along the WA coast ranging from 6 km to 33 km in radius. The area of each exclusion zone is based on a modelled reduction in potential encounters of 75% around the most vulnerable colonies, and 50% for the remaining colonies.

As the TDGDLF has been a predominately demersal gillnet fishery since the mid-1980s, the potential of interactions between demersal longlines and ETP species are less known.

An Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) of the Temperate Demersal Elasmobranch Resource (TDER) in 2021, scored the potential risk of TDGDLF fishing activities to ETP species 
[@Watt2021]. The potential impact to seabirds, dolphins, white sharks and grey nurse sharks were deemed acceptable under current management arrangements (i.e. a negligible to medium score) [@Watt2021]. A high risk was given to ASLs where there is potential for interaction with commercial gillnets and a data-poor environment.


#### Habitat interactions
TDGDLF operators generally deploy demersal gillnets on sand/soft sediment. Habitat that is inherently unstable and dynamic in nature. Demersal gillnets are deployed infrequently over approximately 40% of the fisheries’ area and as they’re lifted directly from the benthos (rather than dragged), each net is likely to have a small footprint [@Watt2021].
As the TDGDLF has been a predominately demersal gillnet fishery since the mid-1980s, the potential of interactions between demersal longlines and habitats are less known.
The 2021 TDER ERA scored the potential risk of TDGDLF fishing activities to a number of habitats [@Watt2021]. The potential impact to sand/soft sediment, reef and vegetation were deemed acceptable under current management arrangements (i.e. a negligible to low score) [@Watt2021].


## Fishing survey
A total of 55 fishing days (79 gillnet and 63 longline deployments) were done across the WCDGDLF (13 fishing days; 12 gillnet and 10 longline deployments), SDGDLF Zone 1 (20 fishing days; 22 gillnet and 23 longline deployments) and SDGDLF Zone 2 (22 fishing days; 45 gillnet and 30 longline deployments).

### Onboard observer program
#### Catch composition
The number of individuals sampled by species and fishing gear is presented in Table 9. Overall, the shark and ray catch was dominated by Port Jackson, dusky, gummy, whiskery and sandbar sharks. The most frequently caught species were captured by both fishing gears with the exception of stingrays which were mostly captured by longlines and hammerheads, which were only captured by gillnets. The scalefish catch was dominated by pink snapper, queen snapper, blue groper and West Australian dhufish. Blue groper and some of the most commonly discarded scalefish from gillnets, such as buffalo bream and dusky morwong, were not captured by longlines. Similarly, queen snapper was captured by longlines in very low numbers.

```

<br>

The overall observed catch composition by method and zone is shown in Figure 31. For the WCDGDLF, the gillnet catch was dominated by dusky, Port Jackson and gummy sharks and the longline catch was dominated by pink snapper and dusky, gummy and Port Jackson sharks. 

In the SDGDLF, for Zone 1, the gillnet catch was dominated by Port Jackson, dusky and whiskery sharks and the longline catch was dominated by pink snapper, and Port Jackson and dusky sharks. Finally, for Zone 2, the gillnet catch was dominated by dusky, Port Jackson and whiskery sharks and the longline catch was dominated by Port Jackson and gummy sharks and pink snapper.

<br>

Species composition differed among some zones and fishing methods with the nMDS showing a variable degree of separation (Figure 32).

The term method-zone explained 33% of the variation in the dissimilarity distances (Table 10). There were significant differences in the catch composition of gillnets in the WCDGDLF vs SDGDLF (Zones 1 and 2), in the catch composition of gillnets in Zone 1 vs longlines in Zones 1 and 2, and in the catch composition of gillnets in Zone 2 vs longlines in the WCDGDLF and Zones 1 and 2 (Table 11).

#### Number of individuals caught by snood configuration
The number of individuals (all species combined) caught by each snood configuration is shown in Figure 34. Overall, the different number of configurations used caught a similar number of individuals, except for Ezi-baiter 10/0 hooks, which caught relatively less individuals.

<br>

#### Longline deployment efficiency, hook baiting time and percentage of lost hooks/snoods 
For the longline fishing sessions, most of the baited hooks were deployed (Figure 35). The number of baited hooks per person-hour ranged between ~50 and 200, with an average of just under 100 hooks per person-hour. Overall, a relatively small percentage of deployed hooks/snoods were lost; however, for a couple of deployments, a large percentage was lost due to a double break in the mainline. Observers recorded the hook configuration of damaged or lost hooks/snoods (i.e. hook size, type and snood) but did not categorise whether hooks were straightened or the snood snapped. Hence, it was not possible to directly compare the percentage loss of monofilament and wire snoods but it must be noted that based on a comparison of lost circular hooks (which tend to bend less than Ezi-baiter hooks) with monofilament or wire snoods, 60% were monofilament snoods and 40% were wire snoods.

#### Catch rates for the main commercial species
For the main commercial species, the distribution of observed catch rates by method and zone is shown in Figure 36 and the standardised catch rates are shown in Figures 37–39 and Appendix 2. For blue groper and queen snapper, longline catches were negligible (Figure 36), so these species were excluded from the longline standardisations as there was no information to estimate model coefficients. Similarly, for the WCDGDLF there was not enough information to estimate coefficients for longline-caught whiskery shark and for longline- and gillnet-caught sandbar shark. As for the analysis of historic catch and effort, gillnet and longline catch rates are not directly comparable due to differing effort units but, overall, longline catch rates were higher for gummy shark, pink snapper and West Australian dhufish across all zones (Figures 36 and 37).

To display the full range of observations, the x-axis was square-root transformed.](`r path`){width=800px,height=800px}

<br>

For gillnet-caught individuals, standardized catch rates were significantly higher in the WCDGDLF than in Zone 1 for dusky shark (Table A.2.1, Figure 37), significantly higher in Zone 2 than in the WCDGDLF for whiskery shark (Table A.2.5, Figure 37), significantly higher in Zone 2 than in Zone 1 for sandbar shark (Table A.2.7, Figure 37), significantly higher in Zone 1 than in Zone 2 for blue groper (Table A.2.13, Figure 37), and significantly higher in Zone 2 than in Zone 1 and the WCDGDLF for queen snapper (Table A.2.14, Figure 37). Other zone comparisons were not significantly different.


For longline-caught individuals, standardised catch rates significantly increased with hook size for West Australian dhufish (Figure 38, Table A.2.12).

#### Size composition for the most commonly caught species by fishing method
For the most commonly caught species, the observed size distribution by fishing method is shown in Figure 39. The gillnet and longline size distributions showed considerable (>60%) overlap for most species with the exception of pink snapper, Port Jackson and nannygai.

<br>

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed significant differences between gillnet and longline size frequency distributions for dusky, gummy and Port Jackson sharks, pink snapper and nannygai (Table 13).

<br>

The standardised mean size (Figure 40) of gillnet-caught individuals was significantly higher for dusky (Table A.3.1), gummy (Table A.3.3), sandbar (Table A.3.5) sharks and nannygai (Table A.3.12), and significantly smaller for Port Jackson shark (Table A.3.7), West Australian dhufish (Table A.3.9) and pink snapper (Table A.3.10).

#### Number of individuals and species retained and discarded
The number of retained and discarded individuals by species, and the size range and released condition of discards are shown in Table 14 for gillnet-caught individuals and Table 15 for longline-caught individuals. 

Overall, a higher percentage of gillnet-caught individuals was retained (Figure 44 top pane) and there was significantly higher probability of retaining a gillnet-caught individual (Figure 45, Table A.4.1). Dusky, whiskery and gummy sharks were the most commonly retained species from gillnets whereas pink snapper, and gummy and dusky sharks were the most commonly retained species from longlines.
Port Jackson shark was the most commonly discarded elasmobranch from gillnets and longlines whereas buffalo bream and dusky morwong were the most commonly discarded teleosts from gillnets. For both fishing methods, the  majority of discarded individuals was released in good condition (release condition=1, Figure 44 bottom pane).

#### Dropouts, bait loss, depredation, gaffing and position in water column
The number and percentage of dropouts by species and fishing method is shown in Table 18 (for deck camera 2 only) and Figure 46 (deck camera 2 and subsurface camera). For both fishing methods, the percent of dropouts was generally very low for commercial species but it was higher for discarded species.

There was no contrast in the gillnet data and for most longline-caught species (most observations were for 'retained', i.e. did not dropped out) to estimate the dropout probability (Tables A.5.1 and A.5.2, Figures 47 and 48). There was, however, enough contrast in the data to estimate the longline dropout probability for smooth stingray and southern eagle ray (Table A.5.2), which was high (Figure 47). These species showed a high resilience, with all (southern eagle ray) or most (smooth stingray) individuals swimming way after dropping out from longlines (Figure 48).

Overall, commercial species had low dropout rates, ranging from 0 to up to 0.00006 individuals per m haul-hour for blue groper caught in gillnets and 0.00124 individuals per hook haul-hour for pink snapper caught in longlines.

Overall, 0.031 baits were lost per hook-hour (Table 22) whereas 0.0003 caught-individuals per m hour were depredated from gillnets (Table 23). No depredation events were observed for individuals caught by longlines.

The relative position in the water column as inferred from the relative position of longline-caught individuals from a weight or pressure float is shown in Figure 50. Most observed dusky and whaler sharks were caught near the pressure floats whereas most pink snapper and the other shark and ray species were caught near the weights.

<br>
The estimated probability of capture near a weight is shown in Figure 51. For Port Jackson shark and western wobbegong the estimated probability showed substantial error due to the lack of contrast (all individuals were caught near the weight); however, the other species showed acceptable probability estimates (Table A.6.1).

#### Behaviours observed by underwater cameras
Thirteen different behaviour types were observed from underwater cameras mounted on gillnets and longlines for the main taxonomic groups (Figure 52) and main commercial species (Figure 53). Overall, for both fishing methods, all taxonomic groups and main commercial species, 'swim past' was the most commonly observed behaviours, followed by 'swim through' for gillnets and 'bait feeding' for longlines.

### Comparison of observer and deck camera 1
Congruence between OM and EM derived from deck camera 1 was high for commercial and the main discarded species (Figures 54 and 55).

There was a relatively good fit to the 1:1 relationship for all species combined (Table A.7.1, Figure 56 top pane), commercial species (Table A.7.2, Figure 56 middle pane) and discarded species (Table A.7.3, Figure 56 bottom pane). There were no significant differences between gillnets and longlines indicating that congruence between OM and EM was not affected by type of fishing method.

<br>

For the most-commonly observed species (n>5), the percentage difference for each species was relatively small, particularly for those species with larger sample sizes (Figure 57).

The multivariate statistics showed a good congruence between OM and EM derived from deck camera 1 with no data clustering (Figure 58) and no significant differences in the catch composition derived OM and EM for gillnets (Table 24) and longlines (Table 25).

### Comparison of observer and deck camera 2
A very similar pattern to the one observed from deck camera 1 was observed from deck camera 2 where there was good congruence between OM and EM (Figures 59–63, Tables 26, 27, A.7.4–A.7.6).

### Endangered, Threatened and Protected species
Overall, the number of observed ETP species (Figure 64) was very small compared to the overall number of non-protected species observed (Figures 52 and 53). 
From the underwater cameras (Figure 64, top pane), the most commonly observed behaviour for gillnets and longlines was ‘swim past’ (predominately for smooth stingrays, followed by white shark, Australian sea-lion (ASL), and humpback whale). The second most commonly observed behaviour was ‘bounced off’ for gillnets (smooth and black stingrays) and ‘attracted’ for longlines (smooth stingray and pied cormorant).
From the subsurface camera (Figure 64, second pane), the most commonly observed behaviour for gillnets was 'diving' whereas one ASL and one grey nurse shark dropped out dead and alive, respectively, and one white shark was caught. For longlines, 'drop out' was the most commonly observed behaviour (smooth stingray and white shark) followed by 'diving' and 'caught'. 
From deck camera 2 (Figure 64, third pane), one 'feeding' and one 'drop out' event was observed for gillnets. For longlines, >10 smooth stingrays dropped out. For longlines, 'drop out' was the most commonly observed behaviour (smooth stingray), followed by 'caught' (cormorants) and 'feeding' (seabird).
From deck camera 1 (Figure 64, fourth pane), longline-caught was the only observed behaviour (smooth stingray and little black cormorant).
Finally, onboard observers reported a range of behaviours (Figure 64, bottom pane). The most commonly observed behaviour was ‘feeding’ for gillnets (mostly seabirds and one ASL) and ‘diving’ (seabirds) for longlines. Observers also reported cases of caught ETPs both dead and alive, which was mostly oversized dusky sharks for gillnets and mostly smooth stingrays for longlines.

<br>

### Habitats
The types of habitats identified from underwater cameras are shown in Figure 65. For gillnets, most of the gear deployments were done on substrate (comprised of mostly coarse sand, followed by rock and cobbles), followed by macroalgae (comprised of erect fine and coarse branching, and canopy forming). Longlines were deployed on erect fine branching macroalgae.

```
![Figure 65. Habitat types observed by the underwater cameras set on demersal gillnets and longlines.](`r path`){width=800px,height=800px}

<br>

The quantification of habitat damage exerted by gillnets is shown in Figure 66. Overall, only a very small percentage of the analysed frames (~4.5 m of net) showed signs of habitat damage (top pane), and when damaged was observed, it comprised of mostly macroalgae (middle pane). For the analysed frames, when habitat damage was observed, it comprised mostly of 0 to 5% of each frame (bottom pane).

### Satellite tagging and blood sampling
The depth profile for the discarded satellite-tagged Port Jackson sharks is shown in Figure 67. For the initially-tagged individual, the tag detached the day after deployment (tag # 200432). For the five sPAT tags set to detach if the shark was a constant depth for >48 hours, one tag was not detected either due to detachment or transmission failure and four tags detached after the programmed 30-day deployment period, indicating survival from the catch and release process. These sharks showed a clear day-night movement pattern where sharks showed little to no movement during the day and active movement during the night.

<br>

The blood lactate concentration for discarded Port Jackson sharks is shown in Figure 68. Overall, lactate concentration averaged 1.97 mmol L^-1^ and ranged between 0.84 and 4.7 mmol L^-1^, the latter corresponding to an individual in release condition 3. There was no clear relationship between lactate concentration and total length or soak time.

Participating processors have processed fish for between `r min_yr.fshn` and `r max_yr.fshn` years, `r Sex`, `r Ab` were of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander origin. These processors had household sizes of `r House` and are based in `r n.by.zone`. Two processors owned the processing plant whereas the other leased it (Figure 69). Family engagement in fish processing ranged between 2 and 5 members and, between 60 and 100% of the family income originated from fish processing (Figure 69), with processors keeping `r income.processor` of the total processing revenue as personal income.

The price range paid to fishers (shark trunks and fins; whole scalefish) and processors (fillets) is shown in Figure 70. For fishers, average shark price ranged from AUD 3.5 per kg of 'other sharks and rays' to AUD 16.5 per kg of shark fins whereas average scalefish price ranged from AUD 5.5 per kg of 'other scalefish' to AUD 16.7 per kg of dhufish.

For processors, average shark price ranged from AUD 19 (retail) and 14 (wholesale) per kg of 'other sharks and rays' to AUD 29 (retail) and 21 (wholesale) per kg of dusky shark whereas average scalefish price ranged from AUD 30 (retail) and 26 (wholesale) per kg of 'other scalefish' to AUD 60 (retail) and 56 (wholesale) per kg of dhufish.

The types of body parts (in addition to flesh and fins) sold by fishers and processors is shown in Figure 71. Fishers and processors sold fins to overseas exporters but did not sell other shark body parts.

For the base-case scenario of 1000 hooks deployed for 4 hours once a day, longline relative mean performance (i.e. longline performance over gillnet performance) was `r Mn.rel.per` (`r Low.rel.per`-`r Upp.rel.per`, 95% CI). However, for the S1 scenario (i.e. 1000 hooks deployed for 4 hours twice a day), longline relative mean performance was `r Mn.rel.per_S1` (`r Low.rel.per_S1`-`r Upp.rel.per_S1`).

Based on 2019-20 landings, almost 50% of landings were caught by vertically-integrated fishers, i.e. operators that catch and process the catch (Figure 78). Of the `r WA.all_processors` finfish processors located in the West Coast and South Coast Bioregions, `r WA.all_processors_shark` processed sharks and rays in addition to scalefish, of which `r TDGDLF_processors` processed mostly sharks and rays, which were all sourced from the TDGDLF.

# Discussion
The current report summarises historical information and generated novel information on the catch, relative efficiency, habitat impacts and economics of demersal gillnets and demersal longlines in southwestern Australia. In addition, this study used a range of different cameras to collect novel information not previously available for these fishing methods. The key findings from this study are:

* Demersal gillnets and demersal longlines have different species compositions across the different zones that comprise the TDGDLF. Overall, most of the main commercial species were captured by both fishing methods though in different proportions with gillnets catching a greater number of species (retained and discarded) and showing a higher probability of retaining a caught-individual. Overall comparisons (i.e. all years and spatial blocks combined) from monthly returns showed a higher proportion of sharks in the catch composition of both fishing methods. However, this differed for ‘comparable records’, daily logbooks and the fishing survey which all showed a higher proportion of scalefish in the longline catch. The shift from monthly returns to daily logbooks coincided with the prohibition of metal tracers so a relatively lower proportion of sharks (which can bite through monofilament) in the longline catch composition derived from daily logbooks was expected. In contrast, the analysis of ‘comparable records’ (which for monthly returns included records using wire tracers) and fishing survey data (which included records using both mono and wire tracers) still showed a higher proportion of scalefish in the longline catch despite the use of wire tracers. It must be noted, however, that the catch rates of sharks collected during the fishing survey, particularly for those species with serrated triangular teeth like dusky, copper and sandbar sharks, may be underestimated due to the loss of hooks/snoods if those hooks/snoods were lost due to shark biting through the snood or bending the hook. Finally, all chartered fishing vessels that took part of the survey have traditionally fished with gillnets and a learning stage is expected for the use of longlines. Hence, a lower catchability could be expected therefore influencing longline catch rates. 
* Although demersal gillnets and demersal longlines have different effort units, overall patterns can be inferred. The catch rates of these two fishing methods varied depending on species. Demersal longlines showed higher catch rates of pink snapper, West Australian dhufish and gummy shark but negligible to very low catch rates of blue groper and queen snapper. For other main commercial species, differences in demersal longline and demersal gillnet catch rates were not as evident.
* Information on the use of wire or monofilament snoods for longline-caught individuals was not available in the commercial catch and effort returns. For the fishing survey, where both wire and monofilament snoods were used, no significant differences in catch rates were found between snood type. This, however, may be an artifact of the relatively low number of individuals caught in the 55 fishing days conducted and the relatively small size of the most-commonly caught shark species which may not be as capable of biting through the monofilament snood as larger individuals. Since the prohibition of metal tracers (i.e. wire snoods), anecdotal information from multiple fishers indicates an increase in snood loss due to bite-offs by species with serrated triangular teeth and therefore, a reduction in their catch rates. Information on hook/snood loss collected in this study suggests a higher loss of monofilament snoods, however, the information collected cannot distinguish whether the hook was bent or the snood snapped/cut through.   
* There was a clear reduction in fishing effort across the TDGDLF due to management intervention since the historic peak. This translated into a reduction in the number of vessel and ports participating in the TDGDLF. In particular, demersal longline effort has substantially declined, and is at a historic low.
* The majority of discarded individuals showed a good release condition. In particular, Port Jackson shark, the most-commonly discarded species in the TDGDLF, had a very high post-release survival rate.
* Overall, dropout rates were low for both fishing methods, particularly for commercial species. For discarded species, most dropouts were in good condition.
* Despite the popular perception of gillnets being ‘indiscriminate walls of death’, the most commonly observed behaviour by underwater cameras was ‘swim past’. This was consistent for all taxonomic groups observed, including ETPs.
* Electronic (EM) and onboard observer (OM) monitoring showed very similar catch compositions.
* Demersal gillnets were mostly set on coarse sand and to a lower extent, macroalgae, and had very limited damage on the different habitats where the gear was deployed.
* The socio-economic survey generated novel information not previously available for the TDGDLF.
* Most of the catch landed by fishers is sold to processors, who, in turn, sell most of the processed catch to local retailers and direct to public or interstate.
* Most of the TDGDLF fishers and processors costs are spent within local government areas.
* The TDGDLF employs up to 150 people and has an overall annual market value through the supply chain of up to AUD 20 million, considerably larger than its GVP.
* Anecdotal information provided by longline fishers challenges the financial viability of manually-baited longlines, which require longer working hours (e.g., the average baiting time in this study was just under 100 hooks per person-hour), incur in bait losses (31 baits lost per 1000 hook hour observed in this study) and may result in lower shark catch rates due to monofilament bite-offs (although not observed in this study).
* Demersal longlining is less economically efficient and considerably more labor and time intensive than demersal gillnetting if hooks are baited manually. If baiting time can be reduced, through for example automatic-baiting, longline performance will considerably increase. However, this would require a bigger operation (bigger boats and larger crew). In addition, our comparisons did not put a monetary value to the additional occupational hazard from handling hooks, the considerably longer hours (due to mostly baiting time) required for longline fishing and the difficulties experienced by the interviewed full-time longline operator in securing stable ongoing crew, which, for a similar wage, would prefer crewing for a demersal gillnet boat.   
* Finally, due to longlines’ higher catch rates of scalefish and current restrictions on scalefish catches, the use of demersal longline in inshore waters, particularly in the WCDGDLF, is unlikely to proceed due to the current status of the West Coast Demersal Scalefish Resource. 
* A consideration could be given, however, to alternative unit conversions for demersal longline in offshore-deeper waters (>250 m) where the use of demersal gillnets is logistically impractical and the likely catch of pink snapper and West Australian dhufish is reduced. Noting, the offshore demersal scalefish suite in the West Coast Bioregion is managed to recovery benchmarks under the West Coast Demersal Scalefish Resource Harvest Strategy 2021-2025.
