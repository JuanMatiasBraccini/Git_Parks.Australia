**NOTES FROM STEERING COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER IN DISCUSSION:**
  
  **DPIRD to prepare a policy statement to accompany the Research Report regarding, among other considerations, hook and net equivalence, and possible use of longlines in deep water. This was unlikely to be expected until the end of March 2022 following finalisation of the research report**
  
  **Reasons why results for economic comparison LL vs GN should be use cautiously: page 55 Knuckey**
  
  **Notes from Steering Committee presentation:**
  **3:1 ratio seems to be ok (shift in scalefish catch when moving away from 3:1 ratio)**
  **Conclusion: inshore in West Coast, not achievable to use LL due to high catches of snapper; consider moving offshore to deeper waters; untapped resource, not fishable with nets. Catch composition by zone and gear: 30/12/2008 Prohibition on Line Fishing (Metal in Lines and Traces). Fishers claim this will affect shark catch rates, i.e. relatively increase in scalefish catch rates if using mono compared to a decrease in shark catch rates if using mono. Although mono vs wire no significant differences in catch rates, use fishers comments on loss of hooks when using mono and hence to financially viable. Advice on future use of longline and in what form. Compare GN vs LL (economics, catch rates, etc). Markus has great insights into the economics of longlines..he's now shfiting to gillnet due to bad longline economics, loss of hooks, long working hours.**
